This project focuses on analyzing the risk factors associated with heart attacks using the "Indicators of Heart Disease (2022 UPDATE)" dataset. The objective is to build a classification model that predicts whether an individual is likely to experience a heart attack and to identify key risk factors. The dataset includes valuable health, lifestyle, and demographic information collected through general health surveys. Through data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling, the project aims to provide insights into heart attack risks for the general population and aid in healthcare decision-making. Key findings include the prediction of heart attack likelihood (Yes or No) and identifying the most significant risk factors.
